To test your device, you present product X to a group of 40 individuals, and ask them to fill out a survery assessing how much they like the product (larger score means they like it more). Then, you have the individuals wear the device, present product X, and assess how much they like of the product. You want to know if the device reliably increases, decreases, or does not affect their liking of product X. What test would you use and why? What result would indicate that their liking has increased?"

If the differences between the not wearing the device vs. wearing the device is positive, this would indicate a increased liking of product X."
